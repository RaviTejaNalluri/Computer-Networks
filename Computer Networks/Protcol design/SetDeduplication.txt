Specification 1 : Client-Server Set Deduplication/Intersection

Extend the code from the previous task to allow the server to provide an
additional service called "Set Intersection". This is defined as follows:

1. Both client and server generate numbers within a common range.
The size of the lists is same for Specification 1.
2. The client sends her list to the server.
3. The server computes the intersection and sends back the output.

To note: The client needs to indicate the type of service required (Deduplication/Intersection). The server should handle the request appropriately.


Specification 2:  Memory management

Specification 2.1: 
Repeat the above where the client generates a list of unknown (i.e., unknown to the server in advance or not a mutually agreed service) size.
The server needs to be able to handle such cases.

Specification 2.2* (Bonus marks):
Repeat specification 2.2 for peer-to-peer interaction, i.e., select your neighbors machine to provide the service for you. One neighbor is client and other is server.
